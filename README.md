## Installation
You can download the latest version of Kiva for Windows 64-bit by downloading through the releases. The .exe file should be contained within the .zip file.

DirectX 11 is required for the program to run, which you can find [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=17431).

## Usage
After downloading the app, install and run the program. Many settings have a question mark button next to them, that should help clear up the purpose of many confusing settings.
